The series of portraits discusses the relationship between consumerism and humans. When humans are greatly affected by consumerism, which means they overly focus on money and material pleasure, they tend to do absurd things. As depicted in the series, the man is using an advertisement newspaper as his tie, pouring alcohol into his eye as an eyedrop, and putting himself into a Walmart bag while holding a price tag as if he is an item, etc. The man was wearing a suit, also showing that he conforms to social norms. It exactly fits Camus’s quote that “The divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity.”

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/10.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

The rest of the images in this post are all zoomable, arranged into different mini-galleries.
